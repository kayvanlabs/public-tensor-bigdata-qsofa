This project contains a function to build an ROC curve given class labels and classification scores for a set of data points and computes the area under the curve. The function also chooses a point on the ROC curve and returns different performance metrics (e.g., accuracy, sensitivy and specificity). The point is selected using five possible methods, specified using an input to the function. For more details, see the documentation within AUC.m. An example demostrating how AUC.m could be called can be found in testAUC.m.

Added in "ROC_AUC.m" to compute ROC curves and AUC. Works for images and image volumes as inputs.
